# BLE_ESP32

### ESP32 : 

  Fake Heartrate Sensor [File: server_fake_heartrate]
  - Uses heart rate measurement UUID and updates the display number by 1 every second. 
  - Good to learn about characteristics and descriptors and general BLE stuff
  Fake Heartrate Sensor [File: server_mpu6050_heartrate_fake]
  - Pushes X axis acceleration data using heartrate measurement UUID
  - Combines MPU6050 code with BLE server
  
Arduino : 
  MPU6050 [File: mpu6050_arduino]
  - MPU6050 code for accessing all the sensors
  Sensor Data Plot [File: Real_Time_Plot_From_Arduino_Serial]
  - Plots real time graph from MPU6050 data
